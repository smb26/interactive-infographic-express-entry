For the final project of the course User Interface Design Principles, the students had the opportunity to choose between making an animation, an interactive data-set or an infographic. 

As two international students, me and my classmate, Tat Dat Hoang, we decided to create an hybrid between the last two options: an interactive infographic about the process some people go through to be able to become a permanent resident in Canada. There are countless ways to get the residency, and after a lot of research we decided to focus on presenting the information that is relevant for Econommic Imigrants(1), specially the ones who decides to attend a public study institution.


### The inspiration

After the information is gathered and filtered, we decided that we wanted to our infographic to have a ludic feel of a boardgame board, to contrast with the serious information presented.

While the final design was made by Dat using resources from websites like freepik, I was responsible for the interaction, adding animations on hover and data-visualization api like google maps api and amcharts.
