For the final project of the course User Interface Design Principles, the students had the opportunity to choose between making an animation, an interactive data-set or an infographic. 

As two international students, me and my classmate, Tat Dat Hoang, we decided to create an hybrid between the last two options: an interactive infographic about the process some people go through to be able to become a permanent resident. There are countless ways to get the residency, and after a lot of research we decided to focus on the information that had some relevance for our personal case.
